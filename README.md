# IOS-DontSleepApp
An IOS application which will not make the device sleep. I was in a situation to keep my IOS device not to sleep because need to trigger selenium automation tests overnight. Since IOS device will not unlock itself when tests are triggered, created an app which will make the device awake, when this App is launched.
