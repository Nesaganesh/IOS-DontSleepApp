# IOS-DontSleepApp
An IOS application which will not make the device sleep. I was in a situation to keep my IOS device not to sleep because need to trigger selenium automation tests overnight. Since IOS device will not unlock itself when tests are triggered, created an app which will make the device awake, when this App is launched.

Download the DontSleep zip file.

Open the DontSleep.xcodeProject, press (Commad + B) to build the App, Connect your device and check the compactability of IOS version and Provision profiles.

Run the App, this will now install 'DontSleep' app on to the connected device.
